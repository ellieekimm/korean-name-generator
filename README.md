# korean-name-generator
This is Node.js application that employs the Express framework to create a web-based Korean Name Generator. 

Within my main index.js file, I configure an Express server to serve static files and handle routes for generating, saving, and pronouncing Korean names. It utilizes the **"korean-name-generator"** package to generate names based on user-selected gender. Users can generate, like, save, and listen to names, and the application utilizes the **"say"** library for text-to-speech functionality.

Users access the main page with buttons to select gender and initiate name generation. Liked names are displayed alongside the generator interface, enhancing user engagement with the application.
